Summary:This project demonstrates expertise in network security knowledge by using the NIST Cybersecurity framework to analyze  a network security incident,i used the framework to navigate through the different steps of analyzing the incident and then integrated my analysis into a general security strategy to improve the organization network security.
Tools: NIST CSF(Framework),MS WORD(for documentation)
Challenge:The organization recently experienced a DDoS attack, which compromised the internal network for two hours until it was resolved, During the attack, The organization’s network services suddenly stopped responding due to an incoming flood of ICMP packets. Normal internal network traffic could not access any network resources. The incident management team responded by blocking incoming ICMP packets, stopping all non-critical network services offline, and restoring critical network services. As an analyst,for this project i am tasked with analysimg the incident and integrating the analysis into improvement of the organization network security.
Actions:Following the NIST CSF five core function
Firstly, i summarised the security event including information about the security event, its cause, the impact, and the response.
Secondly, i identified the type of attack occurred and which systems were affected
Then i outlined where and how the organization can improve to further protect it network and prevent future occurrence
Next, i reconmended detection methods the team can use to  monitor and analyze network traffic, software applications, track authorized versus unauthorized users, and detect any unusual activity on the network.
Next i developed a response plan for future cybersecurity incidents
Overall,i reflected on all the information i gathered about the incident in the previous steps to consider which devices, systems, and processes need to be restored and recovered, then i highlight steps that needs to be taken to help the organization recover from the cybersecurity incident
Result & Impact: The key findings of this project was that the attack was carried out by a malicious actor who targeted the organization network with an ICMP flood attack which led to an distributed denial of services (DDoS) attack, this attack affected the entire internal network
Successfully outlined ways to improve the organization network security, developed detection methods to detected unusual activity on the network, then created response plan against future incident.
